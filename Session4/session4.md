## 1.1 .. Create the file BUT we need to have permission to execute it so we will change the permissions for this file to be executable
![Step1 1](https://github.com/MohanadKh03/Linux-OSC/assets/67065678/a8b15f40-accb-4978-ac11-0b6134a45900)

## 1.2 .. ``Using nano because it is easier for me`` .. We need to get the current logged user's name and the kernel's version so we just echo both of the commands needed for it
![Step1 2](https://github.com/MohanadKh03/Linux-OSC/assets/67065678/ac8b6b82-f326-4648-98e0-1d914369d016)

## 1.3 .. After we exit nano , let's just run the script 
![Step1 3](https://github.com/MohanadKh03/Linux-OSC/assets/67065678/c59f071d-71d5-465d-9ab3-bc91ecbb68f9)

## 2.1 .. Create the file and give it permission to execute then enter nano to start shell scripting
![Step2 1](https://github.com/MohanadKh03/Linux-OSC/assets/67065678/bf9974e3-b2e6-4482-a902-cb959e40ae39)

## 2.2 .. The script itself 
![Step2 2](https://github.com/MohanadKh03/Linux-OSC/assets/67065678/76aa2939-1d3c-4bb7-90c7-c9deb75cf7d9)

## 2.3 .. Testing the script "I created the file in Documents after it showed me No File Exists to test it" 
### NOTE: I had a problem in passing the parameters as i took it copy/paste as it is but i changed the user's home name to my own then it worked as expected
![Step2 3](https://github.com/MohanadKh03/Linux-OSC/assets/67065678/37b60a89-3014-4551-a1ee-297c6dc5914d)

---
## 3.1 .. Create some dummy files "as shown in the example" and the shell file ... DONT FORGET TO ADD EXECUTE PERMISSION
![Step3 1](https://github.com/MohanadKh03/Linux-OSC/assets/67065678/cc44a0d7-a80d-468c-98d5-bec5bf4ebff0)

## 3.2 .. So for the script itself .. Loop through all the files with this extension and rename it then increment the counter
![Step3 2](https://github.com/MohanadKh03/Linux-OSC/assets/67065678/c30db7d9-5ca3-4fba-bf92-867bb00e19b8)

## 3.3 .. Testing the script ``using ls before/after``
![Step3 3](https://github.com/MohanadKh03/Linux-OSC/assets/67065678/70f24119-430e-42fd-b4f7-bfc2e274b4e8)

## 4.1 .. Yet again let's create the file and change permission to be executed
![Step4 1](https://github.com/MohanadKh03/Linux-OSC/assets/67065678/a7994c7d-32a5-4bfd-8460-50466a32deff)

## 4.2 .. Now using nano we are inside the file let's make the calculator logic , It's very simple but the syntax is just different than normal programming because it's shell scripting obviously
![Step4 2](https://github.com/MohanadKh03/Linux-OSC/assets/67065678/a71881a9-6a38-49ce-ac4a-782e61f1b171)
## 4.3 .. Testing the script out , Done !
![Step4 3](https://github.com/MohanadKh03/Linux-OSC/assets/67065678/8dea9ff3-4c30-4e15-9b36-5fbd4555ace0)
